## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub Issue Search**: Check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**: Try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs quickly.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A clear and concise description of what the bug is
> 
> The browser/OS environment in which it occurs. 
>
> **Steps to reproduce the behavior:**
> 1. Go to '...'
> 2. Click on '....'
> 3. Scroll down to '....'
> 4. See error
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
