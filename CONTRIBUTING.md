# Contributing to the Project: 
Please review the following guidelines in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Issue Tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)).

* Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one be sure to have:

1. Use the GitHub search and check if the feature has already been requested.
2. Think about whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
3. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case (merits of the proposed feature) and why it is likely to be common.
