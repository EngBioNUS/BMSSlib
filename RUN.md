# Quick Start 
[Spyder], the Scientific Python Development Environment, is a free integrated development environment (IDE) that is included in Anaconda. The IDE includes editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. Refer to the [Anaconda Documentation] for more details. 

- Launch Spyder (BMSSenv) from your start menu or Anaconda Navigator. 
- In Spyder, check if the right Python version (3.6.5) is used in the IPython console shown at the right bottom.  
- IPython console allows users to run code by line, cell, or file, and render plots right inline.
- Editor is where users can input all their codes for running. 
- Click on the green Run button to execute files. 
- To display the output Graphics in a separate window, select Tools --> Preferences --> IPython console --> Graphics, change the option of Backend from Inline to Qt5. 
-	Click Apply then OK
- Close the Spyder IDE and reopen the IDE from Start menu to apply the changed setting.

## To Run Example File
- To get started, at Spyder, File --> Open to browse and open the example file (__*Example_InducibleSystem, Example_ConstitutiveSystem, or Example_LogicGatesSystem*__) in .py located in the __BMSSlib-master/Examples/InputData__ folder. Select the file based on your system of interest. 
 
 __Note__: With proper installation process, you should be able to run the example file without errors. If there is any error shown at the console after running the file, please restart your Spyder IDE and try again.
