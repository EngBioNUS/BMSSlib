## Overview:
BMSSlib is a package that can be used to automate the model development and selection processes for gene circuit designs built upon a library of pre-established model formulations (ordinary differential equations (ODEs)). This package supports the commonly designed gene circuits (with increasing complexity), ranging from inducible promoter systems and constitutive promoter systems to logic gate systems such as NOT, AND, and OR gates. The platform provides a means to efficiently derive the best model candidate that could capture the transient dynamic profiles of a biopart or device using characterization data. The characterization data is based on commonly used fluorescence measurement using microplate reader.
