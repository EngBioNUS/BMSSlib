The following source files describe all the pre-established kinetic models for the three different regulatory systems: 
- ***InduciblePromoterLibrary_.py***

__*Note__: New models can be added in these files.

The three files below include the main operation functions of BMSS:

__*Note__: Users can select the models to be tested under the *function* **RunModels** by commenting out those unwanted models.
